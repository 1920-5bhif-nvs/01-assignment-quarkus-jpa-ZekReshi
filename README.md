This project is a simple ReST application that is used to store and retrieve data about a coin collection.

The server relies on a postgres database that can be accessed by the following url:

`jdbc:postgresql://192.168.99.100:5432/postgres` (default VM docker address)

By default the credentials are user:`postgres` password:`admin`.

If your database credentials do not match you can change them in the `application.properties` file.
